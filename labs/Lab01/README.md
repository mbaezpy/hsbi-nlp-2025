# Practical Session — Week 2 (Regex & Text Processing)
This session puts the text processing concepts we discussed in class into practice. This is our first lab session, so we are prone to face some hiccups (as we already experienced) so I appreciate you understanding. In addition, some of the instructions we agreed upon now might still be changed in the following sessions. 

The focus for this session is for you to complete a short regex exercise and implement a rule-based spam filter in the lab notebook (building upon a skeleton implementation).


## Materials (notebooks)
Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `labs/` or repository root:
- `VL02_Regex.ipynb` — lecture + **regex exercise** (complete the exercise in the notebook).  
- `VL02_Text_Processing.ipynb` — lecture + demos about normalization, tokenization and lemmatisation, etc.  
- `Lab1_Spam_filter.ipynb` — **lab notebook**: follow the step-by-step cells to implement the rule-based spam filter. 
- (Optional) `Lab1_Pandas.ipynb` — helper notebook with small Pandas examples.

Follow the repository instructions for setting up the environment to run the python notebooks. 



## Seminar
- Work through `VL02_Regex.ipynb` and `VL02_Text_Processing.ipynb`. It's important that you reflect on the outcomes and experiment with changes.
- Complete the regex exercise inside `VL02_Regex.ipynb`. The exercise is self-contained and includes small checks.

## Lab session (what to do in the lab)
Open `Lab1_Spam_filter.ipynb`. The notebook already contains starter code and helpers to test outputs. Follow the instructions in the notebook cells to:

1.	implement a small text-processing pipeline,
2.	implement the rule function predict_spam_rule(...),
3.	apply the rule over the dataset and compute TP/FP/FN/TN, precision/recall/accuracy,
4.	perform error analysis and record at least three FP/FN examples with suggested fixes.
	

## Deliverables / Submission
Follow the submission instructions provided in class. The deliverables include:
- Completed `Lab1_Spam_filter.ipynb` tasks (as instructed in the notebook)

This week we'll try submission via the ILIAS system. If that does nott work we will switch to GitHub or shared folders.
